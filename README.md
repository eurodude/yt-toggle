This Chrome extension is a personal project for myself to ***fix*** my YouTube distraction problem. Maybe this could help someone else! (It is under the MIT-License so have fun!)

***Disclaimer:*** This is **NOT** removing ads! It is meant to support the creators we like to watch and don't get distracted by other videos first! It is not meant to attack or steal from YouTube! Just make it personal again!

*It has been tested with Chrome, Chromium and Vivaldi.*

## functionality

Using this extension, I can now hide or show the comments, description and suggestions by clicking the Icon of the extension. Like that, I can now focus my whole attention on the video I intend to watch.

The Extension also automatically redirections YouTube.com to the subscription feed. This helps me watch what I intend to watch on YouTube.

## Installation and use

Download the ZIP and extract it on your Computer. Then go to your extensions and import it. You might have to be in developper mode depending on your browser! 

As soon as it is installed, you will always be redirected to your subscription page and you can click on the extension-icon to toggle the comments, description and suggestions on or off.
